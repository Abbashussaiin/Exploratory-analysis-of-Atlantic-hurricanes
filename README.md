Hurdat2 is a database of hurricanes and similar storms produced by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
It contains data on
• the track each storm followed (latitude-longitude coordinates)
• the wind speed in knots (1 knot = 0.52 m/s) and the classification of the storm at each point along its
track.
• the point at which each storm crossed onto land if it did cross onto land (“landfall”)
and a number of other variables, all organised by a unique ID code for each storm and sometimes a name.

Databases like this are crucial for understanding how climate change has affected patterns of extreme weather
and predicting how the choices we make about carbon emissions shape extreme weather in the future.
